# LearningRust

Trying to learn rust doesnt have to be hard. i've set up some code-examples here that im working on while trying to learn,
these are projects done by someone with no experience in the language. they should not be considered a "tutorial" in any way.
they will naturally not follow best practices or any "good standards" but they are functional examples of how a new person
uses the language to solve problems.

lets call them "a pragmatic aproach to problem solving with unfamiliar technology", if it works it works. feel free to comment,
improve on or in any way shape or form mess with the code ðŸ¤“


## Project Euler

these projects are coding and math challenges, usefull for thinking about problem-solving, the first few challenges
are not really about solving the problem itself as much as it is about understanding how to implement
the solution.

i think i did the first three pretty well. you can find all the challenges in [the project euler archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
